# Applications that I install

>I don't like Spotlight and I disable it in favour our [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com). I use the powerpack which comes in with a lot of features.  
> Checkout their website and there are several articles on how you can use it online.

> [Adguard](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://apps.apple.com/de/app/adguard-f%25C3%25BCr-safari/id1440147259%3Fmt%3D12&ved=2ahUKEwituOWyoJWJAxWLov0HHUCdDGAQFnoECCkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw021ao67eqJl05v1_mXra3Y) plugin on Safari and [uBlock](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) on Chrome to block annoying ads  
>
> [Choosy](https://choosy.app). This is paid app and costs 10$ but worth every penny since I use several rules to switch between Safari and Chrome automatically. 
> 
> [Spectatcle](https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle) for window management. I've mapped several shortcuts on my Mouse (MX Master) to achieve the perfec window management that I need.
